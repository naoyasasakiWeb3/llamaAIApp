# LLaMA2 with PDF Processing and BERT Example

This example demonstrates how to set up a text processing pipeline using the LLaMA2 model for natural language understanding, combined with BERT embeddings for document processing. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

1. **Initialization**: We start by importing necessary libraries and initializing the LLaMA2 model with specific settings, including a request timeout.

2. **Preparing for Text Extraction**: Using `PDFReader` from the `llama_index` package, we can load and process text data from a PDF document.

3. **Tokenization and Model Preparation**: The text is then tokenized using BERT's `AutoTokenizer`, and the `AutoModel` is loaded to convert the textual information into embeddings.

4. **Processing Documents**: The documents are read from a PDF file, concatenated into a single string, and then tokenized. This tokenized data is fed into the BERT model to generate vector representations of the text.

5. **Querying**: The generated embeddings can be used to query specific information from the text, demonstrating an application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for information retrieval.

This code snippet highlights the power of combining state-of-the-art NLP models like LLaMA2 and BERT for processing and analyzing documents in a Python environment.
